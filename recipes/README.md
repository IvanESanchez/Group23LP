# RecipeBox 1.0

> Recipe app. 

> This a demo I created following a tutorial from Brad Traversy. The UI is from a small social network app. It has functionality that we do not need and is not related to our project like creating profiles with job experience, education, github info.

> This demo is just for showcasing the basic endpoints that we need like Sign in, Register, Add/Delete a recipe, etc.

> I used Moongose to communicate with MongoDB because I read that sending emails with Nodemailer is really easy to implement using Schemas. Moongose allows for better organization and structure.
